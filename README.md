# WeedMate

*Your friendly neighborhood weed pricing CLI app, written purely to sharpen C skills and simulate sketchy cannabis economics.*

## What is WeedMate?

WeedMate is a terminal-based C application designed to simulate managing a cannabis dispensary. Adjust prices, browse your "strains," and immerse yourself in a CLI environment that's more educational than ethical.

It's also a clean, modular project demonstrating good practices for beginners learning modern C:

- Proper multi-file organization
- Clean headers, structs, and macros
- Terminal UI with alternate-screen buffer
- Input validation and handling
- Basic encapsulation

Do note, I'm not as of yet qualified to know whether any of this is true. Take it with a grain of salt.
