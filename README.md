# WeedMate

*Your friendly neighborhood weed pricing CLI app, my starter project for my C learning journey*

## What is WeedMate?

WeedMate is a terminal-based C application designed to make learning how to build CLI apps more fun ang engaging.
The code is meant to be noob friendly, and readable. Comments for clarity are provided, mostly around less noob friendly function calls.

It's also a clean, modular project demonstrating good practices for beginners learning modern C:

- Proper multi-file organization
- Clean headers, structs, and macros
- Terminal UI with alternate-screen buffer
- Input validation and handling
- Basic encapsulation

Do note, I'm a noob, so you may find bugs, or areas that can be improved. I'm by no means a professional programmer.

## 📥 Custom Input Library

WeedMate comes with a **fully modular input library** that replaces C's cursed `scanf()` with a safer, no-bullshit alternative.
It's designed for beginners who understand the issues with `scanf()` but are not yet ready to write their own parsing logic from scratch.

Features:
- Uses `fgets` + `strtol` / `strtof` / `strtod` internally — no garbage left in stdin.
- Graceful handling of invalid input with helpful error messages.
- Rejects junk like `"abc123"` when expecting numbers.
- Cleanly parses the most common types of input.
- Optional filtered character input (`getCharInputFiltered("yn")` style).
- Easy to extend, dead simple to read.

`scanf()` can chordle my balls. This is for people who don’t want to spend three hours debugging why their `scanf("%d")` keeps skipping lines.

## 💾 Save File Support

WeedMate now supports persistent strain names using a hidden save file:

- Save file path: `.weedrc` (created in the same directory as the binary)
- Format: plain text, one strain name per line (15 lines total)
- Max name length: 19 characters (20 including null terminator)

### 📝 Behavior

- On startup, if `.weedrc` exists, WeedMate loads strain names from it.
- If any line in the save file exceeds the max length, the file is considered corrupt and is deleted.
- Renaming a strain will update `.weedrc` with all current strain names.
- If the file doesn't exist, default strain names are used.

You don't need to manage this file manually — WeedMate handles it for you.

## 🛠️ How to Build

You need `cmake` and `make`:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
To build debug or release builds, replace the `cmake ..` command with one of the commands below

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

Then run the executable:

```bash
./weedmate
```
